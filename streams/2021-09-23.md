# Stream: 2021-09-23
### Note-taking Apps
- I'm probably gonna switch to Roam Research because Obsidian is making me lose my mind.
- Tru is on the Roam Research train again.

### Crypto
- Going to look into two technologies to do this: Ethereum and Solana.
- This will be the new version of my old channel point rewards:
	- TTS
	- Light Control
	- Fog Machine
	- OBS Control (change scene, enhance, etc.)
		- We'll use `simple-obs` to control OBS
	- Your idea here...
- Ethereum
	- Ethereum will be expensive because of gas.
	- A couple ways to implement this:
		- A per-transaction fee on a single stream contract.
		- A stream token ($VJJ) that you pay a fee to get, and allows you to access the stream contract.
		- A stream token ($VJJ) that allows you to perform actions through a web portal (cheap).
	- Thankfully we can just deploy new stream contracts whenever we want. So we can always do one approach and change it later.
- Solana
	- Have not looked yet, but I heard it's cheap.

### Whole Noods
- Messaging
