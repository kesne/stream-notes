# Stream: 2021-07-21
#### Warp
- Have a few invites that I'll be giving away throughout the stream.
- Probably will give away 3 total, beginning, middle, and end of the stream. If you miss one of them, stick around for the next!
- Must be:
	- Following on Twitch / Twitter
	- In our Discord.

Off-stream
- Did I migrate to pnpm off-stream?
- Decided to pass on the draft revamp for now, but still copied some ideas from it.
- Worked a little bit on the ingest layer
- Introduced a common type layer
	- Can't put runtime values here though which is sad.
- Investigated nx
	- Seems neat, bundles node apps with Webpack which is interesting and solves a lot of node workspace problems.
	- Might _eventually_ move to it, but would require the app to grow significantly in size to make it worth it.
	- Do not like the single set of dependencies approach, but it does make _some_ sense (forcing a single version of deps for all packages, can make package management / upgrades easier).
- Slimmed down the Docker images a little bit

Today
- Going to work on cleaning up the ingestion layer.
- Integrating mailauth into ingestion
- More draft cleanup
- Non-reply messages (new threads!)
